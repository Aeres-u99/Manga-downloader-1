You'll need pip to install this. If you don't have pip, check out the Install pip file that i've uploaded.

Within your scripts file in the python folder you'll find an easy_install file.

Simply type 'easy_install beautfiulsoup4' in cmd (you must navigate to the easy_install file) and just wait for it to download and install.
